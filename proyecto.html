                <h5 class="card-title text-center">Our Project</h5>
                <p class="card-text">We developed an educational game called “SeekEarth,” an interactive experience that fuses NASA satellite data with predictive simulations to explore the impact of human decisions on climate change and natural disasters. Players can take on different roles - from mayors to entrepreneurs - in configurable pre-determined campaigns, where every decision influences ecosystems and communities in real time.
                    What makes our game unique is its dual purpose: while players learn about the interconnectedness of Earth systems in an entertaining way, their decisions and behaviors generate valuable data that can be used in scientific research and environmental policy planning. </p>

                <h5 class="card-title text-center">Impact</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Our “SeekEarth” game uniquely solves the challenge of communicating how Earth systems are globally interconnected. Through an interactive experience using real NASA data, players can see and experience firsthand how their decisions - whether as mayors, business people or citizens - affect multiple environmental systems simultaneously.</p>

                <p class="card-text">We provide an educational and entertaining experience that allows users to understand how the Earth's systems are interconnected through interactive learning. We use dynamic narratives based on real events and NASA satellite data to provide an accurate view of global environmental impacts. In addition, the solution collects data on user decisions, which will be used for research and governance.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title text-center">Methodology used</h5>
                <p class="card-text">To organize our project, we have used the following methodologies:</p>
                <p class="card-text">Scrum: it is an agile framework that allows us to divide the project into short cycles, called “sprints”. Each sprint focuses on a specific part of the video game development, which makes it easier to maintain a constant pace and evaluate progress. Through daily meetings and reviews, we encourage communication and continuous improvement, allowing us to be flexible and adapt to challenges.</p>
                <p class="card-text">Design Thinking: has guided us in understanding the needs of our users. By applying the phases of empathizing, defining, ideating, prototyping and testing, we have developed an engaging narrative for the video game. This process ensures that the users' voices are heard at every stage, resulting in an intuitive and meaningful final product.</p>

                <h5 class="card-title text-center">What is our goal?</h5>
                <p class="card-text">The main objective of this video game is the students' understanding of the impact they make with certain actions on planet Earth. To accomplish this, we take as a reference SDG #13, which promotes those projects that focus on actions to improve climate conditions. There are several mechanisms to meet this objective, such as the artificial intelligence feedback system, which processes the information acquired to generate innovative solutions to natural disaster situations.</p>
